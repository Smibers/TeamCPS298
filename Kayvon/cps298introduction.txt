Hi! My name is Kayvon, I'm a couple of years into my curriculum and I am taking this course in order to transfer to EMU hopefully next semester. I have taken every other computer science course here for this degree minus the java spring framework class that I am taking alongside this class. I've worked on a few projects outside of class but they were very minimal. I have taken online classes before although I always prefer taking classes in person. I help stay organized by plotting out the class schedule on my calendar so I am notified about important upcoming dates. My interests including photography, biking, and occasionally I like playing games with my friends.
