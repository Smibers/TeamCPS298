Hello y'all

My name is Jun Won and I'm finishing up my degree at WCC this semester. I love food, cooking and eating and basically all activities that involve food. Every year on June 1st, which I dubbed Jun(e) Won(e) Day, I make a feast to share with the community and do fundraiser for different nonprofits. I'm looking forward to meeting and working with y'all!
