Hi i am Ben,

 Previously I have graduated from MSU and am now finishing a degree from WCC/EMU in Com Sci. I am currently working toward a career in Software Engineering or Programming of sorts Outside of class I like to build computers, playing video games, and hockley. I am also an avid metal detectorist and like finding reminants of the past.
