Hi, my name is Saranphorn Jiamjan but I preferred to be called Sarah.
I was born and raised in Thailand and came to the US when I was 16.
I am able to speak 3 languages which are Thai, English, and Korean. 
I enjoy travel since I was young so I've been to several countries.
My hobby is to be at home and play computer games and also enjoy my cat's company. 
I have a cat names Tigger. He's on the chubbier side of an orange cat. lol
